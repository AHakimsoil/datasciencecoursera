## R has five basic or atomic classes of object:
#character
#numeric (real numbers)
#interger
#complex
#logical (TRUE/FALSE)

#the most basic object is a vector
# A vector can only contain objects of the same class
#BUT: The one exception is a list, which is represented as vector but can contain objects of different
               #classes(indeed, thats usually why we use them)

#Empty vector can be created with the vector() function

#Of course, with any great rule, there's always an exception, 
#and this, this one is no exception. So, in this, with vectors, 
#there's one type of vector that can have multiple different types of classes, 
#and that's called a list. So a list is represent as a vector, so there's a se, 
#it's a sequence of objects. But each element of that vector can be a different, 
#can be an object of a different class. So for example, you can have a list

#inf Infinite
#NAN  undefined value 

1/0

0/0
 #
#each object in R is an attribute. 
#So not every, object in R necessarily has attributes, 
#but, but they are, but attributes can be part of an object in R.
